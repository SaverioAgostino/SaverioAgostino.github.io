     <br>

    <h2 class="heading second">Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Scottish shortbread biscuits</li>
        <li>100g salted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 titanium-strength gelatine leaf</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>395g can condensed milk</li>
        <li>100ml lemon juice</li>
        <li>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3 eggwhites</li>
        <li>100g caster sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbs lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h2 class="heading second">Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the base, place the biscuits in a food processor and blitz to crumbs. Add the butter and blitz again until the mixture looks like wet sand. Press the buttery rubble evenly into a 25cm top x 21cm base (5cm deep) fluted loose-based pie dish. Place in the freezer for 10-15 minutes to harden.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for the lemon curd, soak the gelatine in cold water for 5 minutes. Remove the gelatine from the bowl, discard water, then return the gelatine to the bowl, cover with 2 tbs boiling water and stir until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Place the egg yolks in the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and whisk on high speed until pale and thickened. Reduce speed to low and gradually whisk in the condensed milk, lemon juice, zest and salt. Add the gelatine and whisk until combined. Pour the creamy lemon custard into the crust, levelling it out with the back of a spoon, and set in the fridge to chill. It will keep happily for 1-2 days. Lift the pie crust out of its pan; if cold from the fridge, it should come out easily.</li>
        <li>For the meringue, place the eggwhites in the cleaned bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and whisk on high speed until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar, spoonful by spoonful, beating all the while. Keep whisking the meringue until it becomes thick and glossy, then add the lemon juice and vanilla extract. Whisk until well combined.</li>
        <li>Dollop the meringue onto the pie and spread it out so all the glossy, sunny filling is completely covered. Use a spoon to make small peaks in the meringue, then use a kitchen blowtorch to caramelise it, so the tips are lightly golden and burnished. The pie, in its fully assembled glorious form, will happily sit in the fridge for up to 1 day. Best served chilled.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
